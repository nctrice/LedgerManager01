# Ledger PWA (Payments Totals in Payments Tab)

- Tab order: **Dashboard, Payments, Receivables, Stock**
- On launch/refresh: **Payments** tab opens.
- **New**: Payments tab now shows **Total Credits**, **Total Debits**, and **Balance (Debit − Credit)** for the selected ledger (or for **All** if you filter by All). Values update on add/delete and on filter change.

Re-deploy the same way via GitHub Pages.
